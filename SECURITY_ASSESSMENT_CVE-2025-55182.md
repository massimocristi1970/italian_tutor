## Assessment Findings

### 1. Application Architecture
This is a **vanilla JavaScript application** with:
- Static HTML pages (`index.html`, `login.html`, `404.html`)
- Plain JavaScript files for functionality
- Firebase for backend services (Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### 2. Dependencies Analysis

#### Root `package.json`
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "autoprefixer": "^10.4.21",
  "postcss": "^8.5.6",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.10"
}
```
**Result:** No React or Next.js dependencies

#### `functions/package.json`
```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
  "firebase-admin": "^12.6.0",
  "firebase-functions": "^6.0.1"
}
```
**Result:** No React or Next.js dependencies

### 3. Transitive Dependencies
The only React-related package found:
- **Package:** `react-is@18.3.1`
- **Location:** `functions/package-lock.json`
- **Context:** Dev/peer dependency of `pretty-format` (Jest testing utility)
- **Assessment:** 
  - ❌ Not the React framework (just a type-checking utility)
  - ❌ Dev dependency only (not deployed)
  - ❌ Version 18.3.1 is NOT in the vulnerable range (19.x)

### 4. CDN Resources
No React or Next.js loaded via CDN:
- Font Awesome CSS (cdnjs.cloudflare.com)
